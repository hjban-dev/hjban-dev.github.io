# MySQL DML(데이터 조작 언어) SUBQUERY

## SUBQUERY 사용방법 

**SELECT "필드1" FROM "테이블1"**  
**WHERE "필드2" [비교 연산자] (SELECT "필드1" FROM "테이블2" WHERE "조건");**   
으로 사용합니다.  

하나의 SQL 문에, 또 다른 SQL 문을 넣을 수 있다

```SQL
SELECT C.CustomerID, O1.ShipperID_1
FROM Customers AS C

LEFT JOIN(
  SELECT CustomerID , COUNT(OrderID) AS ShipperID_1
  FROM Orders
  WHERE ShipperID = 1
  GROUP BY CustomerID
) AS O1
ON O1.CustomerID = C.CustomerID
```

Customers테이블의 CustomerID와  
Orders테이블에서 OrderID의 주문 횟수를 ShipperID_1로 만들고 두 필드를 합쳐서 새로운 테이블값으로 추출


```SQL
SELECT C.CustomerID, O1.ShipperID_1, O2.ShipperID_2
FROM Customers AS C

LEFT JOIN(
  SELECT CustomerID , COUNT(OrderID) AS ShipperID_1
  FROM Orders
  WHERE ShipperID = 1
  GROUP BY CustomerID
) AS O1
ON O1.CustomerID = C.CustomerID

LEFT JOIN(
  SELECT CustomerID , COUNT(OrderID) AS ShipperID_2
  FROM Orders
  WHERE ShipperID = 1
  GROUP BY CustomerID
) AS O2
ON O2.CustomerID = C.CustomerID
```

---


```SQL
SELECT C.CustomerID, 
IFNULL(O1.ShipperID_1, 0) AS ShipperID_1, 
IFNULL(O2.ShipperID_2, "주문내역 없음") AS ShipperID_2
FROM Customers AS C

LEFT JOIN(
  SELECT CustomerID , COUNT(OrderID) AS ShipperID_1
  FROM Orders
  WHERE ShipperID = 1
  GROUP BY CustomerID
) AS O1
ON O1.CustomerID = C.CustomerID

LEFT JOIN(
  SELECT CustomerID , COUNT(OrderID) AS ShipperID_2
  FROM Orders
  WHERE ShipperID = 1
  GROUP BY CustomerID
) AS O2
ON O2.CustomerID = C.CustomerID
```

NULL값을 0으로 변환
